# Youtube Remake 

Link for deployed website: https://app-3a7ef.web.app/

## Overview
This is a project from my introduction to software engineering lab. We were tasked with remakeing a website. The website I remade is Youtube. The main goal of this lab was to imitate the websites look and feel, functionality was somewhat of a afterthought. 

## Frontend
Throughout the first half of the semester we were taught the basics of the frontend of the website and were tasked with remaking certain parts of our chosen website (so some parts don't have functionality). 

## Backend
The second half of the semester  we were introduced to Firebase. We used firebases realtime databse, hosting, and authentication features.
